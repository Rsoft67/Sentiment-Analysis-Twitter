# Real-Time Twitter Sentiment Analysis


This project focuses on **real-time sentiment analysis of tweets** using a dataset sourced from **Kaggle**.  
The main goal is to compare the performance of two different sentiment analysis approaches:

1. **VADER (Valence Aware Dictionary for Sentiment Reasoning)** – a rule-based and lexicon-driven method.  
2. **Logistic Regression** – a supervised machine learning model trained on the dataset.

### Key Features
- Real-time tweet collection and preprocessing.  
- Implementation of two sentiment analysis methods (VADER & Logistic Regression).  
- **Comparison of both approaches** using multiple evaluation metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, etc.).  
- Visualization of results to highlight strengths and weaknesses of each method.  

### Objective
The project aims to identify which method performs better under different conditions, and provide insights into the trade-offs between **rule-based sentiment analysis** and **machine learning-based sentiment analysis**.
